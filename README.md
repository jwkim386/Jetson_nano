# Start with Jetson nano board
## Power the board
For power the board there are two way :
 1. Power with micro usb connector with the power limitation 5V/2A. In this case you can't have a lot of peripheral because 
 with 2A under 5V there are not enough power supply.
 2. Power with Barrel Jack 5V/4A. To use this power supply is **important to connect the jumper J48**.
